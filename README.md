# Word-Guess-Game

This game is a fill-in-the-letter game. The current functionality is mainly display.

The game should work by choosing a word from a set object to guess. As the letters are choosen, the word should slowly appear. If the word is filled in, a flag of the country will show up and the win counter will go up by one.
